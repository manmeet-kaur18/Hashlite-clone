            <div class="informationa">FAIR INFORMATION PRACTICES PRINCIPLES</div>
            <div class="operators">The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the
                United States and the concepts they include have played a <br>significant role in the development of
                data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how
                they <br>should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect
                personal information.<br>

                In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action,
                should a data breach occur:<br>
            </div>

            <ol type="a">
                <li>We will notify the users via email within 7 business days;</li>
                <li>We will notify the users via in site notification within 7 business days;</li>
                <li>When the personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of
                    natural persons, without undue delay.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <div class="operators">We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that individuals
                have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data<br>collectors and processors who fail to
                adhere to the law.<br>

                This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also
                that individuals have recourse to courts or a <br>government agency to investigate and/or prosecute
                non-compliance by data processors.<br>
            </div>


            <div class="informationa">SECURITY</div>
